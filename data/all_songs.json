(Got that?)\nWho? Me? (Louder)\nWhy? (Got that?)\n\n[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\nFeet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line\nOh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take\nBut I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine\nWalking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?\nI feel so alone on a Friday night\nCan you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?\nIt's like I told you, honey (Louder)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't make me sad, don't make me cry\nSometimes, love is not enough\nAnd the road gets tough, I don't know why\nKeep makin' me laugh, let's go get high\nThe road is long, we carry on\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\n[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane (Louder, alright)\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\nSee Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $125You might also like[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\nLost, but now I am found\nI can see that, once, I was blind\nI was so confused as a little child\nTried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find\nAll the answers, honey (Louder)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't make me sad, don't make me cry\nSometimes, love is not enough\nAnd the road gets tough, I don't know why\nKeep makin' me laugh, let's go get high\nThe road is long, we carry on\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\n[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane (Louder, alright)\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\nWe were born to die\n(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)\nWe were born to die\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo don't make me sad, don't make me cry\nSometimes, love is not enough\nAnd the road gets tough, I don't know why\nKeep makin' me laugh, let's go get high\nThe road is long, we carry on\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\n[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane (Louder, alright)\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\n\n[Outro: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\n(Louder)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\nWe were born to die\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(Louder)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(Louder)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(Louder)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(Got that?)\n(Louder)365Embed",
